tzdb ships an up-to-date copy of the IANA time zone database files. This
package does very little. It is meant to serve as the source of time
zone database information for other time-based packages.

## Installation

You can install the released version of tzdb from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("tzdb")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("r-lib/tzdb")
```
